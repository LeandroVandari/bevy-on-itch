# Introduction
This book is meant as a step-by-step tutorial to prepare a Bevy game to run on itch.io.

This is **not** a tutorial on how to make a Bevy game, or how to upload a game to itch.io. The main goal of this tutorial is to allow game developers to quickly adapt their games to be able to run on the web interface of itch.io (e.g. for game jams).

I will provide a nice set of defaults that will allow for a quick adaptation, but specific use cases may not be covered (if you find one of those, please open an issue).
